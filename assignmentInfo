For assignment 2, I altered the functionality of Ushahidi to allow
for the editing of reports, without being logged in. Once you
actually know what to do, it's quite simple, but getting there was 
difficult. I learned quickly that being logged in under admin made 
a link to edit reports appear in the regular report viewing page, but
I didn't know which file to change to make it appear, and looked in
the applications/views folder. It wasn't there. It's actually in the
default themes folder.

The next thing I had to do was, now that people not logged in could
get to the report editing area without manually typing it in, I needed
to let them actually edit the reports. It would take entirely too
much work to actually make a new web page to let them do it, and 
probably too much to figure out exactly how it's done in the admin
page and put it into the regular viewer for reports, so I decided
to just remove the necessary permissions to do it from the admin page.
As it turns out, that would take entirely too much work. I could comment
out the checks for being an admin if I had to, but there's too many 
things dependant on having privelages, and it requires a user name.
To get around this, i just added an if statement to check if you're
logged in, and if not, I created a fake user with admin privelages
called 'guest', and just redirected you to the login page if you
go outside the reports area, and if you leave the edit area but
stay in reports, it just kicks you back to the normal reports area.
